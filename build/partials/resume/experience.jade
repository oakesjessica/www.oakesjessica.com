          ul
            li Collaborated with a group of four other classmates to build a mobile-responsive application for SportsEngine, to allow their clients to create custom tryout forms and score players based on the categories they created. These scores would then be submitted to the playerâ€™s profile in the SportsEngine API. This application also allows multiple guest users to login at one time and score players during a tryout.
